// This file previously held ~15 hardcoded sample opportunities used as
// placeholder/demo data before the real ingestion pipeline existed.
//
// That static list has been removed (see discussion: platform now sources
// real opportunities via src/lib/ingestion — trusted RSS/API feeds +
// reviewed scraped listings — plus organization-posted entries, all stored
// in Firestore's "org_opportunities" collection).
//
// The `Opportunity` type is kept here because many components still import
// it. `mockOpportunities` is kept as an empty array for backward
// compatibility with any code that hasn't been updated yet — it no longer
// contributes any fake data.
