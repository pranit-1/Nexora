 * trigger, or the scheduled run plus a manual POST — from picking the *same*
 * pending opportunities and paying for both. The second run's summaries were
 * then simply overwritten by the first's.
 *
 * Scope: this is a per-instance guard, not a distributed lock. Serverless
 * instances are independent, so it cannot serialise across them. It closes the
 * realistic same-instance overlap (retries, manual + scheduled, concurrent
 * clients) without pretending to be a cluster-wide mutex. A true cross-instance
 * lock would need shared state such as Firestore or Redis, which this batch does
 * not otherwise touch.
