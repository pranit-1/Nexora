    content: `We collect information you provide directly when you create an account, set up your profile, or interact with the platform. This includes:

• **Account Information:** Name, email address, and authentication credentials.
• **Profile Details:** Education level, field of interest, location, annual income bracket, skills, and interests — used solely to personalise opportunity recommendations.
• **Uploaded Documents:** Files you upload to the Opportunity Wallet (resume, certificates, ID documents, etc.) are stored securely and are accessible only to you.
• **Usage Data:** Anonymized interaction data such as which opportunities you viewed or bookmarked, to improve recommendation quality.`,

• Provide, operate, and improve the NEXORA platform.
• Match and recommend relevant scholarships, fellowships, internships, and STEM programs to your profile.
• Send deadline reminders and dashboard notifications you explicitly opt into.
• Respond to your support requests and communicate updates.
• Ensure the security, integrity, and legal compliance of our platform.

We do not sell, rent, or share your personal data with third-party advertisers.`,

• **Firebase Authentication** for secure login with encrypted credentials.
• **Firestore Security Rules** that ensure each user can only access their own data.
• **Per-user isolated storage** on Cloudinary — your documents are stored in a private folder keyed to your unique user ID.
• HTTPS encryption for all data transmitted between your browser and our servers.

While we take every reasonable precaution, no method of internet transmission is 100% secure. We encourage you to use a strong, unique password.`,

    title: "4. Cookies & Analytics",

Anonymous usage analytics may be collected to understand aggregate platform usage and improve the user experience. This data cannot identify you personally.`,

• **Google Firebase** — Authentication and database (Google Privacy Policy applies).
• **Cloudinary** — Document/file storage (Cloudinary Privacy Policy applies).
• **Google Fonts** — Typography (loaded with privacy-preserving settings).

When you follow external "Apply" links to official program sites, those websites have their own privacy policies which we do not control.`,

    title: "6. Your Rights",

• **Access** the personal data we hold about you.
